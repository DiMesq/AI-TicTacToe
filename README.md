# AI TicTacToe 2014

Human vs Computer TicTacToe game.

This agent is completely programmed for this game and is of no use in any other.
I should note that I wrote this when being introduced to OOP concepts and so the code design is not very good.

# Use
1. Copy the repo code files
2. run `jogo_do_galo()` function from the *play_jogo_do_galo.py* file
